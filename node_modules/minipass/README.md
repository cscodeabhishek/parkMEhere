# minipass

A _very_ minimal implementation of a [PassThrough
stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_passthrough)

[It's very
fast](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K_HR5oh3r80b8WVMWCPPjfuWXUgfkmhlX7FGI6JJ8tY/edit?usp=sharing)
for objects, strings, and buffers.

Supports `pipe()`ing (including multi-`pipe()` and backpressure
transmission), buffering data until either a `data` event handler
or `pipe()` is added (so you don't lose the first chunk), and
most other cases where PassThrough is a good idea.

There is a `read()` method, but it's much more efficient to
consume data from this stream via `'data'` events or by calling
`pipe()` into some other stream. Calling `read()` requires the
buffer to be flattened in some cases, which requires copying
memory.

If you set `objectMode: true` in the options, then whatever is
written will be emitted. Otherwise, it'll do a minimal amount of
Buffer copying to ensure proper Streams semantics when `read(n)`
is called.

`objectMode` can only be set at instantiation. Attempting to
write something other than a String or Buffer without having set
`objectMode` in the options will throw an error.

This is not a `through` or `through2` stream. It doesn't
transform the data, it just passes it right through. If you want
to transform the data, extend the class, and override the
`write()` method. Once you're done transforming the data however
you want, call `super.write()` with the transform output.
